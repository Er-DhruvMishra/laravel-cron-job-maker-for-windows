# laravel-cron-job-maker-for-windows
creates scheduled task for laravel in windows just like cron tab works in linux



double click to run it

drag n drop your project's artisan file on it(this file is just inside your laravel project folder)

press enter........done

if it is saying to replace(Y/N) then a scheduled task with name: 'laravel' already exists.

you can replace it.
